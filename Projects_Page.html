		Discription: This is a small/fast/cool/dumb program I made in C. It replicates a command line/terminal, and I did make this before, but I refactored the<br>entire darn thing to make it more modular, cooler, with more 'shell' commands, etc. This is version <2.1.8>, but there will definitely be more versions coming out<br> with even more cool programs, features, easter eggs (there are some in there), 'shell' commands, etc. You can also type 'help' in the terminal to get command<br> help. Also, if you can make this better, please do.<br>

            Status: Still in development.<br>
